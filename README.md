## Essays on Constraint-Based PC Game Restoration

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/1127941088.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18162766)

Past games were designed around specific hardware and human habits, and when those constraints change, the game itself changes — even if the software still executes.  

This collection examines that idea historically. It explores how hardware, software, and human practice intersect in computing history, and proposes constraint-based analysis as a methodological framework for digital preservation and historical understanding.  

The essays are written to be readable by technically curious players and tinkerers, while also offering a framework historians and preservationists can work with.
